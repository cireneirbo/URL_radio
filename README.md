# URL_radio

A site that allows users to add the URL of their favorite music to a radio-style playlist.

A playlist of YouTube videos is randomly cycled and automatically played. The site uses the YouTube.com iframe API. Users can add YouTube videos to the playlist, which prevents songs from being repeated and duplicate links being added. The site does not store the added songs for later use, and the song list can be reset by refreshing the page.
